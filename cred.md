I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist #83314 in California.  
I earned my Master's Degree in Integral Counseling Psychology from the California Institute of Integral Studies.  
I studied World Religions and Gender Studies at the University of Colorado in Boulder for my Bachelor's Degree.  
I'm trained as a Doula which is a physical, emotional and informational support person for a woman and her family during pregnancy, birth and postpartum.  
I'm a dancer and an artist who embraces and utilizes the healing powers of movement and art in therapy.
I've been meditating for over 15 years and infuse my work with mindfulness and awareness as tools of self-empowerment.

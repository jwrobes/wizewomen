      Welcome to Wize Therapy. I am Bronwyn Wrobel, a devoted healer and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in California #83314 and Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Washington LH 60822228. 

      Are you overwhelmed with the demands of work, kids, partnership, home & health? Are you stressed and discouraged, wondering how everyone around you seems happy and fulfilled? Do you catch yourself repeating the same patterns in your relationships? Does screen time leave you feeling empty and wanting more? I help people with these feelings every day. 

      I provide high-quality Online Therapy & Counseling services. I specialize in phone and video chat therapy with adults and couples. My point of departure toward change is Insight. By looking within and seeking out the blind spots, we investigate the motivational forces behind actions, thoughts & behaviors. By deepening self awareness you gain control and together we craft an action plan that empowers you to make the changes you want in your life. Call for your free consultation today!

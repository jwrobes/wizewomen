      Welcome to Wize Therapy. I'm so glad you're here. I'm Bronwyn, a healer and devoted guide on your journey. You may be here because you're noticing patterns in your life that aren't working. You find yourself in the same type of relationships, surrounded by the same kinds of people, playing out the same dramas. Perhaps your life has become imbalanced and you can't find your way back to baseline. Maybe you're grieving the loss of a companion, a piece of yourself or a dream that never came true. You may be in the midst of a crisis, a betrayal or huge life transition. You deserve compassion and support while you navigate life's challenges. Therapy is an honest and judgment-free place where you can peel the layers off and discover what you want and how to create it.



      I provide high-quality Online Therapy & Counseling services. I specialize in phone and video chat therapy with adults and couples. My point of departure toward change is Insight. By looking within and seeking out the blind spots, we investigate the motivational forces behind actions, thoughts & behaviors. By deepening self awareness you gain control and together we craft an action plan that empowers you to make the changes you want in your life. Call for your free consultation today!

      Welcome to Wize Therapy. I am Bronwyn Wrobel, a devoted healer and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist in California #83314. I provide high-quality Online Therapy & Counseling services. I specialize in phone, email and video chat therapy with adolescents, adults and couples. My point of departure toward change begins with Insight. In Sight. Looking within. Seeking out the blind spots. Apprehending the true nature of things through intuitive understanding. Utilizing vision in the mindâ€™s eye. Investigating relationships, recognizing sources of difficulty, dissecting the motivational forces behind action, thought & behavior. Self Awareness. Know Thyself. There are as many paths in life as there are people. You must look within to find what you seek and through Insight, Inner Sight, you will discover what you need. I am your faithful guide on that journey. Call for your free consultation today!

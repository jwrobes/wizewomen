"Bronwyn is a gifted healer. Her hypnotherapy workshops are relaxing, transformative and inspired. She holds powerful and sacred space right alongside creativity and play. Such a gift!" ~Angie Hensley, LMFT and Founder of Shakti Rising Nor Cal</p>
<p>Mama Love Urban Retreat coming soon! This 2-day workshop for pregnant mamas will feature activities to create Connection, Relaxation and Fun! We will share, journal, move, chant, create, laugh and embody our Selves in new and empowering ways. Pregnancy can be difficult and isolating, with very few outlets available for women. Here, you will share your story and connect to others. You will get all your questions answered about pregnancy, birth and becoming a parent. You will leave feeling informed, supported and refreshed. We will cover the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual aspects of growing life. We will have a raffle for prizes to make your pregnancy as good as it can possibly be! Dates and location will be finalized soon. Email with any questions!</p>

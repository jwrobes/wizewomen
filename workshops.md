"Bronwyn is a gifted healer. Her hypnotherapy workshops are relaxing, transformative and inspired. She holds powerful and sacred space right alongside creativity and play. Such a gift!" ~Angie Hensley, LMFT and Founder of Shakti Rising Nor Cal 
</p>Wize Therapy is hosting a Vision Board workshop Sunday January 13th 11am-1pm at Terra's Temple in Berkeley. The New Year is the best time to create vision, confidence and excitement about what you want. We will meditate, discuss and inspire our personal desires for the year. Then we will develop a road map through a Vision Board art project, practicing our power as deliberate creators. This workshop is perfect for those who want to get clearer on what they want and WHY they want it. Art supplies are provided and you are encouraged to bring any of your own that you especially enjoy working with. Bring a journal and arrive on time! Cost is $20 at the door, RSVP required via email healing@wizetherapy.com 510&#8209;497&#8209;1774

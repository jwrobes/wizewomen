I specialize in ProActive Couples Counseling.  I help new couples build a strong foundation for their relationship up front.  I focus on helping couples establish safety, vulnerability and healthy communication from the beginning.  Together, we create a platform for you and your partner to express hopes, fears and values.  Being proactive at the onset of a new romance sets you up for success.  The two of you start off on the 'same page' and together, develop a vision for your future.  By learning from the past and refusing to re-create the same problems from previous relationships, you give your new love story a real, fighting chance!

After working with adolescents for several years, I have enormous respect for the delicacies of this stage of life.  Most teenagers are striking a balance between managing stress/anxiety effectively while preserving and continuing to build healthy self-confidence.  With guidance and practice, adolescents can develop healthy coping skills that will set them up for success as adults.  Without support and guidance, teens often turn to self-destructive behaviors that become more difficult to unlearn over time.  I've helped teens address social/peer issues, divorce, self-harm behaviors, substance use, eating disorders, etc..  Call or email me with any questions today at wizetherapy@gmail.com 510-497-1774

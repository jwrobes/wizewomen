Teletherapy is an easy, flexible and efficient way of participating in therapy using your phone, computer or tablet.  By removing the obstacles of transportation, we connect in real time over the phone or video chat.  Teletherapy provides convenience and consistency that traditional, in-person therapy cannot offer.  And, you can enjoy the benefits of high quality therapy from the comfort of your own home. Teletherapy is appropriate for anyone who seeks support in changing problematic aspects of their inner or outer life and is effective at addressing everything that in-person therapy addresses. I'm glad to answer any questions you may have about teletherapy.  Email wizetherapy@gmail or call 510&#8209;497&#8209;1774

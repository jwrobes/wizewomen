<p> Second sample paragraph for Bronwyn </p>
Teletherapy is an easy, flexible and efficient way of participating in therapy using your phone, computer or tablet.  By removing the obstacles of transportation, we connect in real time over the phone or video chat.  Teletherapy provides convenience and consistency that traditional, in-person therapy cannot offer.  And, you can enjoy the benefits of high quality therapy from the comfort of your own home. I'm glad to answer any questions you may have about teletherapy.

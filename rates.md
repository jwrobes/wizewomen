My fee is $125 for 50 minutes of Individual Therapy or Life Coaching. My fee is $145 for 50 minutes of Couples Counseling or $185 for 1.5 hours. I offer a sliding scale for those who qualify. My services may be covered in full or in part by your health insurance or employee benefit plan. Please check your coverage carefully by asking your insurance company the following questions:  Do I have mental health insurance benefits? What is my deductible and has it been met? How many sessions per year does my health insurance cover? What is the coverage amount per therapy session? Is approval required from my primary care physician? I will gladly provide you a receipt that you can submit to your insurance company for reimbursement. <p/>Payment is due 48 hours in advance of the scheduled session via PayPal or credit card. <p/>Cancellation policy: You must notify me 48 hours in advance that you’d like to reschedule your session via email or voice mail. If you do not notify me in advance and do not ‘show up’ to our scheduled appointment, you will be required to pay the full cost of the session.
